# Information System Development Methodologies Assignment

## Tasks for the assignment


## Assignment  

### Objectives 
The aim of this project is to develop an information system for a travel company to optimise their call management and in doing so, improve customer experience and increase their potential for sale.
The aim is to create an effective and efficient information that will be able to appropriately match relationship managers and customers based on the relationship managers skill and customers profile.Customers will be able to effortlessly be given possible products that are more suited to their needs and wants to create a higher probability of product purchasing. Relationship managers will be able to tailor their approach to suit the customers preferences and identify the customers target market, allowing them to deliver a stronger sales pitch. 
The system will effectively optimise and improve the call experience for both relationship managers and the customers.
For example, the system will match a customer wishing to purchase a travel package for Europe with a relationship manager who is well informed about that destination, its traditions and the travel packages available. 


### Problem Definition 
Currently there is no system that is able to effectively connect customers to suitable relationship managers. This leads to unproductive sales pitches and thus lower the potential for sales as relationship managers are not properly matched to customer profiles. There is also currently no mechanism in place to gauge the customer's travel preferences prior to reaching a relationship manager which means that customers may be left to wait a long periods of time for service as traffic is not monitored and optimised for greater efficiency and effectiveness. Ultimately,  customers are likely to be matched with a random relationship manager who is currently available for call instead of one who is well informed about their desired travel destination. 

### Stakeholders 
This project has 3 main stakeholders, they are the major travel company, the relationship managers and the customers.

**User Stories** <br/>
The following are user stories written from the perspective of the major travel company, relationship manager and customer. 

*Major Travel Company*
* As a major travel company, I want to develop an information system so that I can improve the operation of our in-house call management centre (CMC).
* As a major travel company, I want the system to automatically dial numbers according to a generated customer target list, so that I can target the best potential buyers. 
* As a major travel company, I want a call routing and distribution routine so that inbound call costs are minimised by reducing per-call handling time.
* As a major travel company, I want to redirect customers to an Interactive Voice Response during busy time, so that I can manage customers the best way possible while maintaining good customer service.

*Relationship Manager*
* As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want the system to provide assistance in serving end-customers (or potential customers) and match end-customers according skill and customers profiles, so that there is improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls.
* As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want a supporting tool to create customer profiles, so that I can segment customers into social and cultural segments according to their postcodes and surnames.
* As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want the system to display buyer details and provide me with guidelines and a script so that I can provide an improved service to the end-customer.
* As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want a calculated customer skill score based on previous call durations and customer profiles, so that I can prioritise customers most likely to purchase.

*Customer*
* As a customer, I want to be matched with an employee based on their performance and product knowledge, so that I receive the best experience for my booking.
* As a customer, I want shorter waiting periods when on hold, so that I don’t feel like I am wasting my time.

**POV Statements** <br/>
The following are POV statements written from the perspective of the major travel company, relationship manager and customer. 

*Major Travel Company*
User | Need | Insight 
-----|------|--------
A major travel company lacking useable technology | The development of a suitable information system specific to the companies needs | The company will improve many aspects of their business with a new system, namely the "operation of our in-house call management centre (CMC)."
An employee of a major travel company, who's job is to contact new potential customers | A system which automatically dials numbers according to a generated customer target list | Natural human bias and decison making isn't working for the current business model

### Approach
Our approach revolved around converting the travel company’s needs into demand, which will improve their business. Design Thinking encourages us to take a customer-oriented approach using agile decision making. In this case study, we recognise the travel company, their relationship managers and their customers as key stakeholders. When looking to remove the stakeholders pain points, the first step is to empathize with the stakeholders. By placing ourselves in the users’ shoes, we can pinpoint their wants, needs and struggles. Key tools we used to do this were Empathy Maps for each stakeholder, User Stories and How Might We’s.

Next, we look to define the problems that we have identified. We believe it is important to know our stakeholders, and their needs, in order to properly define their problems and work towards a solution. This can be done through re-framing the problem(s). By using Point of View statements, we were able to clearly define the problems of each of our stakeholders.

The next stage of our approach follows into the Ideation stage. In this stage, we develop as many ideas for our previously identified problems as possible. At this point of the approach any idea is written down, which we later collate and refine into a feasible solution. Similarly, we use exercises like Brainstorming and Worst Possible Idea to look for more ways to reframe the problems. Following on from this, collating and refining ideas based on potential and through voting revels our most feasible solutions we can then use to prototype.

By prototyping our solutions, we can develop inexpensive, shareable products to help use further identify the best solutions. These can be shown to stakeholders to seek feedback, looking for acceptance, improvement or rejection. This stage also allows us to have a better perspective on real world users and their behaviour. With these products, we can ask questions like, “Would people use it?”, “Would people buy it?”, “Will it be easier for them to use?” and “Will the design be simple and novel?”

The final stage of our Design Thinking approach is iterative testing. We use our prototypes to redefine problems we previously defined and develop greater understanding of the users, their condition, thoughts, behaviour and feelings. As this is an iterative cycle, we can alter and refine in order to rule out problem solutions and therefore derive deeper understanding of our prototypes and ideas, users and their problems.

### Choosen Agile Methodology & Associated Activities 
The agile methodology choosen for this project is SCRUM. SCRUM is an agile process that  focuses on delivering te business value in the shortest time possible and does so through rapid and repeated roduction of working software. It emphasises accountability, team work and agility, it looks as software development as a complicated and unpredictable process. Within SCRUM there are a number of different activities that take place, they are sprint planning, daily sprint, sprint review and sprint retrospective. Each event plays a vital role within the SCRUM framework. 

For this project the following SCRUM activities will take place, sprint planning, daily sprint, sprint review and sprint retrospective, however these activities will be slightly modified to accomodate for the project and team requirements. 

The following modifications have been made:
* Instead of having a separate day for sprint planning, it has been incorporated as part of the daily sprint. It is no longer a formal ceremony, but has been built into the weekly meetings. 
* Daily sprint/stand-up has been replaced with a weekly team meeting. This occurs every Thursday evening and is hosted through Zoom.
* Sprint review is no longer a formal ceremony, but rather a continual process of improving team practices along the development of the project.It is informally conducted through weekly team meetings and messages.
* Similar with the sprint review, the sprint retrospective is no longer a formal ceremony, but rather a continual process of improving team practices along the development of the project. It is informally conducted through weekly team meetings and messages.

The team structure from scrum has also be appropriated as the team does not have a definitive product owner or scrum master, but rather are a unit of self organising individuals whose roles and responsibilities change situationally. 

The duration of a sprint has also been slightly altered to accomodate for the constraints of the project. A typical SCRUM sprint ranges from 14-30 days, however due to the duration of the project, the sprint duration has been changed to 1-Week to better accomodate for the project timeline and constraints. 

Although the ceremonies, team structure and sprint duration from SCRUM have been adapted for this project, the fundamental methodology and ideaology of SCRUM is still implemented as the team is actively working to produce workproducts and artefacts in an agile manner.

As part of the working arrangements, the team will be working collaboratively through GitHub. Each team member is expected to have their own fork, each fork in turn should have a master and a develop branch. Team members should work on the develop branch until a change is finalised, once finalised it may be pushed to the master branch. Upon pushing changes to the master branch, team members should open a pull request with a meaningful name, assign the pull request to themselves and request reviews from the team. If the pull request has been reviewed by at least one team member, the pull request can be merged and closed. Commits should also have meaningful names that makes it easier to trace back through the change history. 

### Assumptions 
Below are some assumptions made throughout the project. 
* Relationship Managers
    * It is assumed that Relationship Managers are all around the same level in the management hierarchy and are not high up in management. This assumption is made as the concerns raised in the empathy map for Relationship Managers illustrates those concerns held by employees following the implementation of the proposed information system whereas managers may be more focused on the return on investment and profits garnered by the proposed system.
    * The empathy map for Relationship Managers also assumes that business is taking place during a normal situation e.g. not during the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus does not aim to address any concerns or issues presented by out of the ordinary situations. 
* Customers 
    * Customers are not quarantined and are free to travel where they choose.
    * Customers do not hang up once they call the centre.
    * Customers are aware of their own score between 1-10.
    * Customers have to have their information registered in the database prior to purchasing a product.
    * All customers are matched with an employee based on their product knowledge and availability.	
    * The demographics of the Customers are not considered in their score.
    * Only inbound customer calls are considered.
    * Customers will hand up after 20 minutes of waiting. 
* Information System - Futura
    * During outbound calls, if a custmer does not pick up their phone, the information system will automatically search for a new target customer and proceed to call them instead.
