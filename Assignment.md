## Assignment  

### Objectives 
The aim of this project is to develop an information system for a travel company to optimise their call management and in doing so, improve customer experience and increase potential for sale.
The system will achieve this by appropriately matching relationship managers and customers based on the relationship managers skill and customer profile, thus optimising the overall call experience for both the relationship managers and customers. 
For example, the system will match a customer wishing to purchase a travel package for Europe with a relationship manager who is well informed about that destination, its traditions and the travel packages available. 


### Problem Definition 
Currently there is no system to optimise the customer to relationship manager process. This leads to a less convincing sales pitches and thus lower potential for sales as relationship managers are not properly matched to customer profiles. There is also currently no mechanism in place to gauge the customer's travel preferences prior to reaching a relationship manager which means that customers may be left to wait a long time for service as traffic is not monitored and optimised for greater efficiency and effectiveness. It also means that customers are likely to be matched with a relationship manager who is currently available for call instead of one who is well informed about their desired travel destination. 

### Stakeholders 
This project has 3 main stakeholders, they are the major travel company, the relationship managers and the customers.

#### Empathy Maps
1. Major Travel Company

2. Relationship Managers

3. Customer

#### POV Statements
* Major Travel Company
    * As a major travel company, I want to develop an information system so that I can improve the operation of our in-house call management centre (CMC).
    * As a major travel company, I want the system to automatically dial numbers according to a generated customer target list, so that I can target the best potential buyers. 
    * As a major travel company, I want a call routing and distribution routine so that inbound call costs are minimised by reducing per-call handling time.
    * As a major travel company, I want to redirect customers to an Interactive Voice Response during busy time, so that I can manage customers the best way possible while maintaining good customer service.
* Relationship Manager
    * As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want the system to provide assistance in serving end-customers (or potential customers) and match end-customers according skill and customers profiles, so that there is improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls.
    * As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want a supporting tool to create customer profiles, so that I can segment customers into social and cultural segments according to their postcodes and surnames.
    * As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want the system to display buyer details and provide me with guidelines and a script so that I can provide an improved service to the end-customer.
    * As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want a calculated customer skill score based on previous call durations and customer profiles, so that I can prioritise customers most likely to purchase.
* Customer
    * As a customer, I want to be matched with an employee based on their performance and product knowledge, so that I receive the best experience for my booking.
    * As a customer, I want shorter waiting periods when on hold, so that I donâ€™t feel like I am wasting my time.

#### How Might We Statements


### Approach


### Choosen Agile Methodology & Associated Activities 


### Assumptions 
Below are some assumptions made throughout the project. 
* It is assumed that Relationship Managers are all around the same level in the management hierarchy and are not high up in management. This assumption is made as the concerns raised in the empathy map for Relationship Managers illustrates those concerns held by employees following the implementation of the proposed information system whereas managers may be more focused on the return on investment and profits garnered by the proposed system.
* The empathy map for Relationship Managers also assumes that business is taking place during a normal situation e.g. not during the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus does not aim to address any concerns or issues presented by out of the ordinary situations.
