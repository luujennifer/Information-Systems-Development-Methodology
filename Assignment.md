## Assignment  

### Objectives 
The aim of this project is to develop an information system for a travel company to optimise their call management and in doing so, improve customer experience and increase potential for sale.
The system will achieve this by appropriately matching relationship managers and customers based on the relationship managers skill and customer profile, thus optimising the overall call experience for both the relationship managers and customers. 
For example, the system will match a customer wishing to purchase a travel package for Europe with a relationship manager who is well informed about that destination, its traditions and the travel packages available. 


### Problem Definition 
Currently there is no system to optimise the customer to relationship manager process. This leads to a less convincing sales pitches and thus lower potential for sales as relationship managers are not properly matched to customer profiles. There is also currently no mechanism in place to gauge the customer's travel preferences prior to reaching a relationship manager which means that customers may be left to wait a long time for service as traffic is not monitored and optimised for greater efficiency and effectiveness. It also means that customers are likely to be matched with a relationship manager who is currently available for call instead of one who is well informed about their desired travel destination. 

### Stakeholders 
This project has 3 main stakeholders, they are the major travel company, the relationship managers and the customers.

**User Stories** <br/>
The following are user stories written from the perspective of the major travel company, relationship manager and customer. 

*Major Travel Company*
* As a major travel company, I want to develop an information system so that I can improve the operation of our in-house call management centre (CMC).
* As a major travel company, I want the system to automatically dial numbers according to a generated customer target list, so that I can target the best potential buyers. 
* As a major travel company, I want a call routing and distribution routine so that inbound call costs are minimised by reducing per-call handling time.
* As a major travel company, I want to redirect customers to an Interactive Voice Response during busy time, so that I can manage customers the best way possible while maintaining good customer service.

*Relationship Manager*
* As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want the system to provide assistance in serving end-customers (or potential customers) and match end-customers according skill and customers profiles, so that there is improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls.
* As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want a supporting tool to create customer profiles, so that I can segment customers into social and cultural segments according to their postcodes and surnames.
* As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want the system to display buyer details and provide me with guidelines and a script so that I can provide an improved service to the end-customer.
* As a Relationship Manager (RM), I want a calculated customer skill score based on previous call durations and customer profiles, so that I can prioritise customers most likely to purchase.

*Customer*
* As a customer, I want to be matched with an employee based on their performance and product knowledge, so that I receive the best experience for my booking.
* As a customer, I want shorter waiting periods when on hold, so that I donâ€™t feel like I am wasting my time.

**POV Statements** <br/>
The following are POV statements written from the perspective of the major travel company, relationship manager and customer. 

*Major Travel Company*
User | Need | Insight 
-----|------|--------
A major travel company lacking useable technology | The development of a suitable information system specific to the companies needs | The company will improve many aspects of their business with a new system, namely the "operation of our in-house call management centre (CMC)."
An employee of a major travel company, who's job is to contact new potential customers | A system which automatically dials numbers according to a generated customer target list | Natural human bias and decison making isn't working for the current business model 
A major travel company system developer | A call routing and distribution routine | Implementing routine into the business will reduce costs
An employee who has worked during the busiest of times at the company | To be able to redirect customers to an Interactive Voice Respinse during busy times | Employees want to maintain the best customer service no matter the situation, however sometimes get overwhelmed by the volume of work at one time

*Relationship Manager*
User | Need | Insight 
-----|------|--------
A Relationship Manager (RM) seeking a better working experience for both myself and my customers | Assistance in serving end-customers or potential customer, and matching end-customer according to skill and customer profiles | The RMs want this improved experience for both themselves and customers, as these changes would improve call routing and the dynamic call flow control
An RM struggling with the current tools in place to develop customer profiles | A supporting tool which creates customer profiles | A tool like this would provide the ability to segment customers socially and culturally, or by postcode and surnames
A Relationship Manager wanting to know the perfect thing to say to customers | A system which displays customer details and provides a guideline or script as to what to say | This would improve customer service
A Relationship Manager | Customer skill scores to be calculated, this could be based on previous call durations and customer profiles | RMs want to prioritise the customers most likely to purchase

*Customer*
User | Need | Insight 
-----|------|--------
Customer | To be matched with employees who have the best performance and product knowledge | Customers want the best custoer experience possible
Customer | Shorter waiting periods when I am on hold | Customers don't want to feel like they are wasting their time

**How Might We Statements** <br/>

* How might we improve the travel company business with the implementation of a new information system?
* How might we ensure the successful integration of a new system?
* How might we train employees to use the new system?

### Approach


### Choosen Agile Methodology & Associated Activities 
The agile methodology choosen for this project is SCRUM. SCRUM is an agile process that  focuses on delivering te business value in the shortest time possible and does so through rapid and repeated roduction of working software. It emphasises accountability, team work and agility, it looks as software development as a complicated and unpredictable process. Within SCRUM there are a number of different activities that take place, they are sprint planning, daily sprint, sprint review and sprint retrospective. Each event plays a vital role within the SCRUM framework. 

For this project the following SCRUM activities will take place, sprint planning, daily sprint, sprint review and sprint retrospective, however these activities will be slightly modified to accomodate for the project and team requirements. 

The following modifications have been made:
* Instead of having a separate day for sprint planning, it has been incorporated as part of the daily sprint. It is no longer a formal ceremony, but has been built into the weekly meetings. 
* Daily sprint/stand-up has been replaced with a weekly team meeting. This occurs every Thursday evening and is hosted through Zoom.
* Sprint review is no longer a formal ceremony, but rather a continual process of improving team practices along the development of the project.It is informally conducted through weekly team meetings and messages.
* Similar with the sprint review, the sprint retrospective is no longer a formal ceremony, but rather a continual process of improving team practices along the development of the project. It is informally conducted through weekly team meetings and messages.

The team structure from scrum has also be appropriated as the team does not have a definitive product owner or scrum master, but rather are a unit of self organising individuals whose roles and responsibilities change situationally. 

The duration of a sprint has also been slightly altered to accomodate for the constraints of the project. A typical SCRUM sprint ranges from 14-30 days, however due to the duration of the project, the sprint duration has been changed to 1-Week to better accomodate for the project timeline and constraints. 

Although the ceremonies, team structure and sprint duration from SCRUM have been adapted for this project, the fundamental methodology and ideaology of SCRUM is still implemented as the team is actively working to produce workproducts and artefacts in an agile manner. 


### Assumptions 
Below are some assumptions made throughout the project. 
* Relationship Managers
    * It is assumed that Relationship Managers are all around the same level in the management hierarchy and are not high up in management. This assumption is made as the concerns raised in the empathy map for Relationship Managers illustrates those concerns held by employees following the implementation of the proposed information system whereas managers may be more focused on the return on investment and profits garnered by the proposed system.
    * The empathy map for Relationship Managers also assumes that business is taking place during a normal situation e.g. not during the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus does not aim to address any concerns or issues presented by out of the ordinary situations. 
* Customers 
    * Customers are not quarantined and are free to travel where they choose.
    * Customers do not hang up once they call the centre.
    * Customers are aware of their own score between 1-10.
    * Customers have to have their information registered in the database prior to purchasing a product.
    * All customers are matched with an employee based on their product knowledge and availability.	
    * The demographics of the Customers are not considered in their score.
    * Only inbound customer calls are considered.
