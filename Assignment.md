## Assignment  

### Objectives 
The aim of this project is to develop an information system for a travel company to optimise their call management and in doing so, improve customer experience and increase potential for sale.
The system will achieve this by appropriately matching relationship managers and customers based on the relationship managers skill and customer profile. 
For example, the system will match a customer wishing to purchase a travel package for Europe with a relationship manager who is well informed about that destination, its traditions and the travel packages available. 


### Problem Definition 
Currently there is no system to optimise the customer to relationship manager process. This leads to a less convincing sales pitches and thus lower potential for sales as relationship managers are not properly matched to customer profiles.
