<h1> Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective. </h1>

Our approach revolved around converting the travel company’s needs into demand, which will improve their business. 
Design Thinking encourages us to take a customer-oriented approach using agile decision making. 
In this case study, we recognise the travel company, their relationship managers and their customers as key stakeholders. 
By doing this, we look to remove pain points for all stakeholders. 
The first step in this process is to empathize with the stakeholders. 
By placing ourselves in the users’ shoes, we can pinpoint their wants, needs and struggles. 
Key tools we used to do this were Empathy Maps, for each stakeholder, User Stories and How Might We’s.

Next, we look to define the problems that we have identified through empathizing with the stakeholders. 
We believe it is important to know our stakeholders, and their needs, in order to properly define their problems and work towards a solution. 
This can be done through re-framing the problem(s). 
By using Point of View statements, we were able to clearly define the problems of each of our stakeholders. 

The next stage of our approach follows into the Ideation stage. 
In this stage, we develop as many ideas to our previously identified problems as possible. 
At this point of the approach any idea is written down, which we later collate and refine into a feasible solution. 
Similarly, we use exercises (like Brainstorming and Worst Possible Idea) to look for more ways to reframe the problems. 
Following on from this, collating and refining ideas based on potential and through voting revels our most feasible solutions we can then use to prototype.

By prototyping our solutions, we can develop inexpensive, shareable products to help use further identify the best solutions. 
These can be shown to stakeholders to seek feedback, looking for acceptance, improvement or rejection. 
This stage also allows us to have a better perspective on real world users and their behaviour. 
With these products, we can ask questions like, “Would people use it?”, “Would people buy it?”, “Will it be easier for them to use?” and “Will the design be simple and novel?” 

The final stage of our Design Thinking approach is iterative testing. 
We use our prototypes to redefine problems we previously defined and develop greater understanding of the users, their condition, thoughts, behaviour and feelings. 
As this is an iterative cycle, we can alter and refine in order to rule out problem solutions and therefore derive deeper understanding of our prototypes and ideas, users and their problems.
